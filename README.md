# TeamProject_NintendoGames
Project investigating Nintendo Games using python, web-scrapping and streamlit

In this project we analyse the Nintendo games sales. The original dataset is available here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/nintendo-games-dataset). We will then add informations to it using web scrapping libraries on Python. All the data will be gathered, analysis and then we will build a dashboard using streamlit as a support to our final presentation.
